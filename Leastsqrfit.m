% This function is the front end call to the feature sizing algorithms that
% used a least squares Gaussian approach. The code takes an image of the
% feature along with the some relevant parameters and fits a non-linear
% least squares Gaussian to the surface.  There are two main options for
% the fit, either regular Gaussian or a continous Gaussian.  The continous
% Gaussian not only assumes a Gaussian shape to the object but also assumes
% that the surface is the results area integration (i.e. a pixel on a
% digital camera).  The continous method might not be useful for erregular
% features but has been shown to work well for digital particle images.
